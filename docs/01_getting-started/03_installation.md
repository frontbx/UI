FrontBx uses `npm` scripts for its build system. The `package.json` file includes convenient methods for working with the framework, including compiling code, building documentation and more.

To use the build system and run the documentation locally, you'll need a copy of FrontBx's source files and `Node`. Follow the steps below to get started:

1.	Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
2.	Either download [FrontBx's sources](../download/index,html) or fork [FrontBx's git repository](https://github.com/frontbx/ui).
3.	Navigate to the root directory and run `npm install` to install local dependencies listed in `package.json`.
4.	When completed, you'll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.

### Using npm scripts

The `package.json` file includes numerous tasks for developing a project. Run `npm run` to see all the npm scripts in your terminal. Primary tasks include:

| Task                 | Description                                                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm start`          | Compiles CSS and JavaScript, builds the documentation, and starts a local server.         |
| `npm run watch`      | Watches all JS, and SCSS source files and run build when changes are made.                |
| `npm run dist`       | Creates the dist/ directory with compiled files. Requires Sass, Autoprefixer, and terser. |
| `npm run docs-serve` | Builds and runs the documentation locally.                                                |
| `npm run css`        | Compiles Sass, prefixes, minifies and bundles CSS                                         |
| `npm run js`         | Compiles minifies and bundles JS                                                          |

### Sass

FrontBx uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for compiling Sass source files into CSS files (included in the build process). There are three access points you will want to use:

*	`scss/frontbx.scss` - Standalone FrontBx Sass ready to build without the icons.
*	`scss/frontbx.bundle.scss` - FrontBx Sass ready to build with the icons.
*	`scss/_variables.scss` - FrontBx Sass variables and configuration - no output.

```scss
@import '~frontbx/scss/frontbx.bundle';
```

```scss
@import '~frontbx/scss/variables';
```

Alternatively, you can use FrontBx's ready-to-use CSS by simply adding this line to your project's entry point:

```JavaScript
import 'frontbx/dist/css/frontbx.bundle.min.css';
```

---

### JavaScript

Import FrontBx's JavaScript by adding this line to your appâ€™s entry point (usually `index.js` or `app.js`):

```JavaScript
import FrontBx from 'frontbx';
```

> FrontBx does not currently offer importing components individually, however this is roadmapped for future releases.
