### npm


Pull in Frontbx’s source files into nearly any project with some of the most popular package managers. No matter the package manager, Frontbx will require a Sass compiler and Autoprefixer for a setup that matches our official compiled versions.

```bash
npm install frontbx
```

const frontbx = require('frontbx') or import frontbx from 'frontbx' will load all of Frontbx’s plugins onto a frontbx object. The frontbx module itself exports all of our plugins. You can manually load Frontbx’s plugins individually by loading the /js/dist/*.js files under the package’s top-level directory.
