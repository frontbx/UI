# Sass

Use FrontBx's Sass source files to customize your own build prior to compiling into CSS.

FrontBx's Sass configuration can be found in the `scss/_config.scss` and `scss/_config-dark.scss` files - with the latter being configuration for **Dark Mode**.

The `scss/_config.scss` houses all the primary Sass variables for everything from setting theme colors to styling individual components. When FrontBx's CSS is compiled, `_config.scss` is one of the first files imported. From there all CSS `:root` variables are generated in `scss/src/base/_root.scss`. For individual components, the Sass variables are assigned to CSS variables which sets the default styling.

Every Sass variable in FrontBx includes the `!default` flag allowing you to override the variableâ€™s default value in your own Sass without modifying FrontBx's source code. To setup this up simply, create your own Sass stylesheet with your variables, then import FrontBX and compile:

```sass
$body-bg: #1d1d1d;

@import "../node_modules/frontbx/scss/frontbx";
```
