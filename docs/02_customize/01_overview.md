How does it work?
-----------------

FrontBx is really easy to setup and even easier to use. FrontBx is written in `SCSS` and vanilla `JavaScript`. It's dependency free and doesn't use `jQuery` at all.

There are a two different ways to use FrontBx:

**Basic Usage**  
The most basic way would be to simply download the latest build, include `frontbx.css` and `frontbx.js` in your project.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="frontbx.css">
</head>
<body>
<script src="frontbx.js"></script>
</body>
```

If you are wanting to use FrontBx this way. You would simply include it in your project and build ontop of it with your own `CSS` and `JavaScript`. If you intend to use FrontBx this way, you can simply skip the `Getting started` part of this documentation and start familiarizing yourself with the FrontBx's `CSS`.

**Recommended Usage**  
The recommended way to use FrontBx however is to build your project using `SCSS`, and integrate your own FrontBx theme. You'll find out more information on how to do this correctly as you follow the documentation.
